<p>The de-stocking phenomenon in the distribution networks has slowed  significantly in the fourth quarter, allowing Trigano to improve its commercial  performance compared to the previous quarters. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="exergue"> Leisure vehicles</p>
<p>Sales of motor caravans (-18.5%) continued to suffer from a wait-and-see  attitude of replacement-oriented customers, while sales of caravans (-3.0%) and  accessories (+1.5%) held up well. <br />
Sales of static caravans (+39.3%) and holiday rentals (+33.6%) remained  on a good momentum.</p>

<p class="exergue">Leisure equipment</p>
<p>The trailers activity (-21.9%) was impacted in particular by the fall in  investment from construction professionals. <br />
In contrast, sales of garden equipment (+14.7%) and camping equipment  (+19.2%) fully benefited from the boom of online distribution and from the delivery  to public markets.</p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
<p>In a  disrupted economic environment, Trigano has implemented action plans designed  to adapt to the reality of the market. With a further decline in stocks, Trigano,  that has confirmed credit lines over a period of three years, reduced its net debt  to around &euro; 100 M,  representing an improvement of more than &euro; 50 M compared to the end of the previous quarter  (&euro; 70 M versus  situation as at August 31, 2008). </p>
<p>The good  reception of the product innovation efforts by the distribution networks and by  customers, together with the reduction of Trigano and distributors' stocks,  augur an increase in sales in 2010. The strict adaptation of production to  demand and the implementation of a large-scale programme of reduction of  structure costs should allow Trigano to regain profitability soon. </p>
