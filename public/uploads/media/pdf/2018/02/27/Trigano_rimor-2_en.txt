<p class="exergue">Acquisition of the assets of the company Autocaravans Rimor</p>
<p>To anticipate a probable finalisation of the divestment process of the company Autocaravans Rimor, the Commercial Court of Siena has decided to entrust the management lease of the assets to the company Luano Camp, subsidiary of Trigano. Luano Camp therefore acquired the entire inventory of Rimor, took over 106 employees and started to produce and to sell motorhomes of the brands Rimor, Kentucky and XGO on 26th March.</p>
<p>This decision allows Trigano to start immediately performance improvement programmes based on the implementation of industrial and&nbsp;commercial synergies as well as cost-reductions (mainly on purchases).</p>
<p>Rimor, located in Poggibonsi (Italy) close to the Italian factories of Trigano, has sold around 1200 motorhomes in 2013/2014. Trigano anticipates full-year sales around &euro; 50M in the short term.</p>
