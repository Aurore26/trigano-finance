<p class="exergue">Leisure Vehicles</p>
  <p>In a still very dynamic European motorhome market, Trigano pursued its quest of market share gains; sales increased by 25.5% in the third quarter (22.5% at constant perimeter).<br>
  Caravan (+15.9%) and accessories for leisure vehicles sales (+9.7%) also benefited from the sharp upturn in demand over Europe. <br>
Furthermore, the investment recovery of campground owners and managers resulted in a growth of static caravan deliveries, up 49.6% in the third quarter. </p>
<p class="exergue">Leisure equipment</p>
<p>Trailers (+4.6%) and camping equipment (+20.9%) activities remained well oriented while garden equipment deliveries, impacted by an unfavourable climatology in the third quarter, remained stable (-0.4%).</p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
<p>The new motorhome and caravan ranges presented to the  distribution networks in the last few weeks were particularly well received,  which led to a general and important growth of firm orders. </p>
<p>The positive orientation of leisure vehicles and  trailer markets in Europe should allow Trigano to go on increasing its activity  and results in 2016/2017 despite the adverse effects of depreciation of the  pound sterling and a drop in consumption in Great Britain subsequent to the  outcome of the recent referendum.Â  </p>
