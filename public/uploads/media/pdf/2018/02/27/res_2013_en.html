<p>Annual sales reached &euro;818.2  M, up 10.5% compared to last year thanks to the contribution of the  acquisitions made in 2012 and 2013. Profitability was however impacted by a  decrease in sales at constant perimeter (-6.3%). Current operating margin  reached 2.9% of total sales. </p>
<p>The acquisition of SEA has generated  an acquisition profit of &euro;19.8 M. Operating result reached &euro;42.9 M compared to  &euro;26.3 M in 2011/2012. </p>
<p>Despite the slight increase  in interest charges, financial result improved by &euro;0.2 M due to a positive  exchange result. </p>
<p>Considering a corporate tax  expense of &euro;10.1 M and the contribution of equity affiliates (&euro;2.2M), the net  consolidated result stood at &euro;32.6 M (&euro;14.5 M in 2011/2012).</p>
<p>Thanks to these results,  Trigano&rsquo;s shareholders&rsquo; equity strengthened to &euro;355.4 M (&euro;328 M as of 31 August  2012). The financial structure remains particularly solid: despite the  acquisition of SEA, net debt at the end of the financial year represents only  10.6% of equity (7.4% in 2012).</p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
<p>In 2014,  Trigano will remain attentive to the changes in the economic environment in its  various countries and will intensify the adaptation policy of its production  capacities and structures to the demand. <br />
In the  medium term, Trigano will pursue its development strategy in Europe that  combines organic growth and acquisitions in the fields of motor-caravans,  accessories for leisure vehicles and trailers.</p>
<p class="exergue">Dividend</p>
<p>The Board of Directors will propose to the General meeting scheduled for 6 January 2014 not to proceed with the payment of a dividend for the 2013 financial year.</p>
<p class="exergue">Governance</p>
<p>On 30 September 2013, the  Board meeting of Trigano decided to refer to the Middlenext corporate  governance code that appears to be more appropriate to the company, with regard  to its size and its capital structure.</p>
