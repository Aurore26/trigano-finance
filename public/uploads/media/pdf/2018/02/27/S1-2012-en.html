<p class="exergue">Leisure vehicles</p>
<p>Thanks to a good performance on the French and German  markets, and despite difficulties in Italy and in the UK where austerity  measures weighed on consumption, motor caravan sales recorded an increase of  4.7% in the second quarter. Accessories for leisure vehicle sales (+8.4% in Q2)  and especially static caravan deliveries (+56.3% in Q2) confirmed their  dynamism. On the other hand, due to over cautiousness of distribution  networks, caravan sales were down compared to last year (-23.9% in Q2). </p>
<p class="exergue">Leisure equipment</p>
<p>Due to the strong seasonality of leisure equipment sales  to the public, the evolution of the turnover of this activity in the first  half-year is not reflecting trends for the year. <br />
Garden equipment (-14.0% in Q2) and camping equipment sales  (-28.6% in Q2) are down compared to last year, as some pre-season deliveries were  postponed due to particularly harsh weather conditions in February. On the other  hand, thanks to the success of sales promotion operations, trailer deliveries  increased by 5.7% in the second quarter. </p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
<p>In a context marked by uncertainty concerning the  evolution of the European economic situation, first half-year profit should be  lower than in the previous financial year, notably due to Trigano&rsquo;s decisions  aimed at both increasing activity and controlling the level of inventories. &nbsp;<br />
In the second half-year, Trigano will remain faithful  to its objective of increasing market shares, notably through the continuation  of innovation efforts and the reinforcement of products competitiveness. <br />
Trigano will also pursue the study of external growth  projects in its main sectors of activity and already acquired in March the  Dutch company OCS Recreatie Groothandel BV, specialized in the wholesale of  accessories for leisure vehicles (&euro;7 M sales in 2011).</p>
