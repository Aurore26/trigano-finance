<p>* : Restatement of  perimeter effect of newly consolidated entities consists of: <br>
  - for entities  entering the consolidation scope in the current year, subtracting the  contribution of the acquisition from the aggregates of the current year;<br>
  - for entities entering the  consolidation scope in the previous year, subtracting the contribution of the  acquisition from September 1 of the current year, until the last day of the  month of the current year when the acquisition was made the previous year.<br>
  No entities  left the consolidation scope during the periods mentioned in this press release. <br>
**  Restatement of the foreign exchange effect consists of calculating aggregates  for the current year at the exchange rates of the previous year. </p>
<p>Leisure Vehicles</p>
<p>During the first quarter, Trigano  strengthened its positions in Europe for all leisure vehicles (+54.4%) thanks  to the support of a solid organic growth rate (+24.6%), and to the integration  of Adria, Auto-Sleepers and Michael Jordan (British dealership of motorhomes  and caravans acquired in September 2017).<br>
  <strong>Motorhome </strong>sales were up 51.3%.  The ramp-up of production capacity and a high order book led to growth of 26.4%  at constant perimeter.<br>
  <strong>Caravan</strong> sales (+8.6% at constant  perimeter) remained well-oriented notably due to a strong growth of living  caravans. The effect of acquisitions led to an additional increase in caravan  sales of 143.0%. <br>
  The takeover of Adria&rsquo;s activity, the extension  of the Spanish production site and the reorganisation of both French sites allowed  to double Trigano&rsquo;s production capacity in <strong>static  caravans</strong>, sales were up 117.6% in the first quarter (+19.8% at constant  perimeter). <br>
Finally, sales of <strong>accessories for leisure vehicles </strong>showed an increase of 10.6%<strong> </strong>(+6.8% at constant perimeter).</p>
<p class="exergue">Leisure Equipment</p>
<p><strong>Trailers</strong> activity was up 13.4% at  constant perimeter and up 21.0% after the integration of Remorques Hubi&egrave;re (acquired  in July 2017).<br>
The evolution of <strong>camping</strong> (-3.7%) and <strong>garden</strong> (-1.9%) <strong>equipment</strong> sales are not  significant in the first quarter, due to the seasonality of these activities.</p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
<p>The rapid and  continuous internal growth over the past three years, combined with major  acquisitions, has radically changed the size of Trigano. Structures and  management systems will be adapted to take this evolution into account and  derive benefits from it on commercial as well as profitability levels.<br>
  Moreover,  Trigano will invest in enhancing its attractiveness to encourage the recruitment  of quality workforce in its subsidiaries.<br>
The integration  of the Adria group is going well; identified industrial, commercial and  purchasing synergies correspond to those anticipated.</p>
