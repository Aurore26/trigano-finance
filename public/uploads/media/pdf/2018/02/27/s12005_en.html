      <p class="noteTable">Nota bene: Eura Mobil group sales up to February 2005 (5.2 M&euro;) are not integrated</p>
      
      <p>The sales evolution during the first semester is in line with forecasts. </p>
      <p>The <strong>Leisure vehicles activity </strong>(LVs) is growing at a high pace in spite of a slump in static caravans sales down by 1.7 &euro;M and of an accessories sales rise (+2.4%) lower than expected. </p>
      
      <p>The <strong>Leisure equipment activity </strong>benefits from Mecanorem integration and from a frank restart of trailers sales (+18.1% within a constant perimeter) which heavily compensates for the anticipated lack of military tents contracts (3.5 &euro;M during  first semester), Garden equipment sales are stable (+1.5%), but this is not significant due to the seasonal activity. </p>
      <p>The acquisition of the Eura Mobil German group of LVs was finalized February 1 st , 2005 . Taking into account the importance of identified synergies and a good integration beginning, the break even objective could be achieved earlier than expected. </p>
      <p>he first semester results should profit from the good sales level and from the production costs control. These results will be published on April 29 th , 2005 and will be commented during a financial analysts meeting.</p>
