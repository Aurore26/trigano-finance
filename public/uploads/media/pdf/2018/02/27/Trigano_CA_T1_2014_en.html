* : +2.9% at constant perimeter<br />
<p class="exergue">Commercial activity</p>

<p>Sales of <strong>motor caravans</strong> have increased in all major markets. Growth in volumes at constant perimeter (+9.4%) is higher than that in revenues (+3.9%) due to the success of the commercial operations initiated on entry-level vehicles at the main autumn shows. <br />
The contribution of SEA (company acquired on 1st January 2013) exceeds the objectives: the renewed confidence of distribution networks led to record 45% growth in volumes. </p>
<p><strong>Caravan</strong> (-1.3%) and<strong> accessories for leisure vehicle</strong> sales (-0.9%) remained affected by the wait-and-see attitude of distributors. <br />
The evolution of <strong>static caravan</strong> sales in the first quarter (-45.4%; &euro;0.5 M) does not reflect a trend for the year. The market should however be difficult due to campsites' managers low appetite for investment. </p>
<p><strong>Trailer</strong> sales (+6.3%) benefitted from a major promotional operation as well as from a slight recovery of the French market. <br />
<strong>Camping</strong> (-19.8%) and <strong>garden</strong> (+4.0%) <strong>equipment activities</strong> are in low season. Their sales evolutions in the quarter are therefore not significant. </p>
<p class="exergue">Financial situation</p>
<p>Trigano's activity in the first quarter has had no significant impact on the company's financial structure that remains characterized by strong shareholders' equity (&euro;356 M as of 31 August 2013) and a low level of indebtedness.</p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>

<p>Trigano will focus its efforts on the implementation of reorganization programmes in order to make the company more competitive. These programmes will translate into a right-sizing of production capacities and by headcount reductions in the support functions in particular in the loss-making business-units and activities.
