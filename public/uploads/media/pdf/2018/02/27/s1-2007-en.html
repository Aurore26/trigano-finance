        <p class="exergue">Leisure Vehicles</p>
        <p>The strong increase in the second quarter sales enables the leisure Vehicles activity to show as at end of February a growth pace almost in line with the year-end target.</p>
        <p>The sales of motor caravans (2Q: +24.7% ; year-to-date: +6.6%) benefit from the shift to the second quarter in the delivery of vehicles initially affected by troubles in the supply of components. Sales of caravans (year-to-date: +3.3%) and accessories for leisure vehicles (+14.8%, of which organic growth: +6.2%) remain well-oriented.</p>
        <p>On the industrial level, the take-off of the plants of Sabl&eacute;-sur-Sarthe and Pe&ntilde;iscola as well as the recourse to additional human resources allowed to make up for the poor productivity of certain business units entailed by the introduction of the new base vehicles and to deliver enough of exhibition models of the new range to the distribution networks.</p>
        <p class="exergue">Leisure Equipment</p>
        <p>The leisure Equipment segment takes advantage of the buoyancy of the trailers activity (year-to-date: +15.6%). Half-year-on-half-year changes in the sales of camping (-30.6%) and garden equipment (+7.7%) shall not be considered as material owing to the seasonal patterns followed by both activities.</p>
        
        <p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
        <p>The strong increase in the motor caravans order book (+32.4% in units as at end of February) coupled with the good performance of the trailers activity enable Trigano to confirm the year-end sales target of 940 M&euro; (+7.7%) for the financial year ending 31st August 2007.</p>
         <p>Disruptions in production entailed by the introduction of the new wheel bases for motor caravans will contribute negatively to the half-year results. The return to normal operating conditions in the second half-year in most business units allows Trigano to forecast an operating profit ratio (operating profit / sales) of about 8.5% for the financial year ending 31<sup>st</sup> August 2007. </p>
