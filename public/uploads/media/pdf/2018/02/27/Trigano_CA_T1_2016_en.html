<p>Sales of <strong>motorhomes</strong> are up 28.1% at constant perimeter and 36.8% by integrating the activity of Rimor  (acquired in March 2015). The growing demand related to the recovery of the  European market and the renewed confidence of distribution networks was  satisfied by the rise in production capacities initiated in the previous year  and continued during the first quarter.<br>
  <strong>Caravan</strong> sales (+15.2%) and sales  of <strong>accessories for leisure vehicles </strong>(+12.9%)  are also well-oriented mainly due to a strong growth outside France.<br>
The evolution of <strong>static caravan</strong> deliveries in the first quarter (+45.0%) does not  reflect a trend for the year.</p>
<p class="exergue">Leisure Equipment</p>
<p><strong>Trailer</strong> sales (+3.9%) benefitted  from the inflexion of the professional trailer market and from market share  gains in Poland and Spain.<br>
<strong>Camping</strong> (-28.7%) and <strong>garden</strong> (-1.1%) <strong>equipment</strong> activities sales evolutions are not significant.</p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
<p>The high level  of motorhomes order backlog will enable to maintain strong growth in sales  during the next months. However, in the second half-year, Trigano sales should  globally evolve in line with the development of the motorhome market in Europe (according  to ECF - European Caravan Federation, motorhome growth is expected between 6%  and 10% in 2016).</p>
<p>Trigano will  continue the implementation of its development programs to gain market shares  in Europe in the motoromes, accessories for leisure vehicles and trailers  sectors and to improve its profitability. Its strong financial structure will  enable Trigano to make the necessary investments in physical and human capital to  reach these objectives and to seize any acquisition opportunity with strategic  relevance.</p>
