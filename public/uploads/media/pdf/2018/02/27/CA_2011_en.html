<p class="exergue">Leisure vehicles</p>
<p>Thanks to its innovation efforts, Trigano comforted  its positions on most market segments. Motor caravan sales confirmed their good  dynamics in the fourth quarter (+8.0%) and recorded 9.8% growth in the  financial year. Static caravan deliveries also increased (+8.5% in the  financial year), confirming the ramp-up of Trigano on this market and its credible  player position for large-account customers. Trigano was also able to maintain  the level of its caravan sales (-1.3% in the fourth quarter; +0.0% in the financial  year); sales of services and accessories for leisure vehicles have as well  reflected the situation of the market (-1.1% in the quarter; -0.8% in the  financial year). </p>
<p class="exergue">Leisure equipment</p>
<p>Trailer sales are slightly up compared to last  year (+1.2%), with a fourth quarter (-6.5%) marked by the decrease of Polish  and Spanish markets. <br />
Lifted by the growth of internet sales, garden  equipment confirmed in the fourth quarter the good level of activity recorded  last year and is up 16.8% in the financial year. Camping equipment activity  remained well oriented as well: sales are up 15.5% in the fourth quarter and  19.9% in the financial year. </p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
<p>The good reception of  2012 motor caravan models by distribution networks was confirmed with the  public with regard to the results of D&uuml;sseldorf (Germany)  and Parma (Italy) shows, despite a less  favourable macroeconomic context. The increase in order books should lead to a  further increase in motor caravan sales in the next financial year. <br />
  Trigano will however  remain watchful to the signals given during next Autumn shows in order to be  able to react quickly to any market volatility.&nbsp; <br />
Thanks to a solid  financial structure (more than &euro;300 M equity and positive cash situation as of  31 August 2011), Trigano will pursue its investments in order to increase its  market shares in Europe in leisure vehicles  and trailers, including through external growth. </p>
