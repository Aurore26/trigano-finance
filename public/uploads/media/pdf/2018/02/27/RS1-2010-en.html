<p>First half-year operational  result reached &euro;-1.2M (&euro;-17.9   M in 2009). In addition to the improvement of gross  margin linked to the increase in sales, half-year results benefited from: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a marked reduction in costs related to destocking </li>
      <li>a strong decrease in costs linked to the adaptation of  workforce</li>
      <li>the benefits of the actions of indirect cost reduction</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thanks to a decrease in interest expense (by &euro;-2.3 M) and to an increase in  foreign exchange results (&euro;+0.6   M), the financial result improved by &euro;3.0 M. <br />
      Considering a corporate tax income of &euro; 0.9 M (&euro;6.7 M in 2009) and  the positive contribution of Loisirs Finance (&euro; 0.9 M), the net consolidated result  stood at &euro;-3.2 M (&euro;-17.1 M  in 2009).</p>
    <p>Half-year accounts recorded further improvement of Trigano&rsquo;s financial  structure. The actions implemented to contain the utilisation of credit have allowed  a limitation of the seasonal increase in working capital requirement to &euro; 3.7 M (&euro; 78.8 M in 2009). In  particular, the stock level has been reduced by &euro;27.0 M compared to 31 August  2009 (&euro;-114 M&euro; compared to 28 February 2009). </p>
    <p>Net financial debt, traditionnally at its highest level as at 28  February, reached &euro; 87.3 M  (&euro; 256.1 M  at 28 February 2009), representing just 30.8% of equity. </p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
	<p>The good level of order books as at end of March 2010 augurs the realization  of a sales level in the second half-year that should allow a return to profit  from the current financial year. With a preserved financial structure (&euro;283.5 M  in equity as at 28 February 2010), Trigano should widely benefit from the  prospects offered by the end of the crisis and return to strong profitability in 2011.</p>
