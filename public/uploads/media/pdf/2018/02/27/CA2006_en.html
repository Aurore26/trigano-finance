      <p>The 4th  quarter sales (173.0M&euro;) post a slight growth compared with the previous  financial year (0.9%). Indeed, the great changes in the range of products due to the new  chassis led to timing differences of motor caravans deliveries.</p>

      <p class="exergue">Leisure vehicles (87.9% of total sales)</p>
      <p>- Sales of <strong>motor  caravans</strong> have reached &euro;596.8m (+14.6%). Driven by a strong increase of  sales in Germany  (+18.7%), the like-for-like growth (+9.2%) was lowered however by a shift in  deliveries about 500 vehicles (15M&euro;) whose invoicing will be deferred until  September 2006. <br>
        - Sales of <strong>other  leisure vehicles</strong> are well-oriented too&nbsp;: the decrease of trailer tents affected by downward UK and Dutch markets is being more than  compensated by the sales increase of touring and living caravans  (+11.9%)  and static caravans (+42.9%). <br>
        - In spite of a fall in sales of awnings, the <strong>Accessories</strong> trade activity shows a significant revival (+7.0%).</p>
        
      <p class="exergue">Leisure equipment (12.1% of total sales)</p>
      <p>- The <strong>Trailers</strong> activity (+1.5%) reflects  some contrast. The sales of the &ldquo;luggage&rdquo; trailers remain stable: The downward  UK and French markets is  being compensated by the increase of market shares in North Europe and Spain. The  sales of professional trailers (+17.2%) confirm their growth potential.<br>
        - The <strong>Camping equipment </strong>activity is back to growth (+1.4%)  whereas <strong>Garden equipment</strong> &nbsp;is still going through hard times owing to the  ever-increasing competition from Asian products and detrimental climatic  conditions (-13.2%). </p>
        
      <p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
      <p>The great welcome of the new  product range by the distributors besides privates led to a sharp increase in  theorder backlog. Thanks to the investment program in new production capacities  (2009 target: +50%) which began this year, Trigano will fully benefit from the momentum of  the motor caravan market in Europe in order to  stand its sustained growth pace.</p>
