    <p>As expected, disruptions in  production entailed by the introduction of the new base vehicles for motor  caravans inhibited first quarter sales :
    <ul>
    	<li>Right-hand drive versions  were not supplied until October, which resulted in a shift in deliveries of  motor caravans for the British market, hence a shortfall of about 8 M&euro; in the first  quarter sales. </li>
    	<li>It  took longer than expected before the supply of certain components could bet  back to normal, which did not allow to catch up the whole stock of vehicles  which had left the production line incomplete. Consequently, the turnover  carried forward to the beginning of the second quarter amounts to about 10M&euro;. <strong></strong></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Sales of  caravans are still making progress (+3.2%) while that of accessories of leisure  vehicles remain well-oriented (+10.7%, of which organic growth&nbsp;: +2.7%).</p>
    
    <p class="exergue">Leisure  Equipment</p>
    <p>It  is the low season for both garden and camping equipment activities, their  turnovers are accordingly non significant.<br>
    The  sales of trailers are making good progress&nbsp;(+14.0%), thanks notably to the  takeoff of the Polish factory.</p>
    
    <p class="exergue">PROSPECTS</p>
    <p>The return to normal operating conditions in all the business units as early  as January 2007 and the high level of the order book allow Trigano to have  confidence in its ability to reach a sales figure of 940 M&euro; (+7.7%) for the  financial year 2006/2007.</p>
    <p>The ambitious programme of increase in production capacities is  expanding in accordance with the expectations. Its completion will allow  Trigano to make the most, in the coming years, of the buoyancy of the active  leisure markets in order to ensure a sustainable growth of its sales and  results.</p>
    <p>These items will be  discussed at the end of the General Meeting being held on Monday January 8,  2007 at 10 am (French time), at the Salons Hoche, 9 avenue Hoche, 75008 Paris.</p>
