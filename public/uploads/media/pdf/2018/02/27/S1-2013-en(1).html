<p class="exergue">2012/2013 Second Quarter Sales</p>
<p>Trigano's activity in the second quarter was impacted by the poor economic environment in Europe and by dealers' policies aimed at reducing their stocks of leisure vehicles and trailers. <br />
Sales in the second quarter reached &euro;192.4 M, up 8.5% (-8.4% at constant perimeter).</p>

<p class="exergue">Leisure vehicles</p>
<p>In a context marked by the decrease of European leisure vehicle markets, Trigano remained committed to its policy of strictly adapting production to the demand of dealers' networks. <br />
  The contribution of external growth operations (SEA, Notin and OCS) has allowed an increase of 5.8% of motor caravan sales and limited the decline in accessories sales to 2.8%. <br />
  However, at constant perimeter, sales of motor caravans, caravans and accessories are down 11.5%, 10.7% and 7.5% respectively in the second quarter. <br />
Deliveries of static caravans, up 22.3%, confirm the strong increase in Trigano's market shares in a difficult market. </p>
<p class="exergue">Leisure equipment</p>
<p>Including the companies Lider and Gaupen-Henger acquired in 2012, growth of trailer sales reached 58.0% in the second quarter. <br />
  Like leisure vehicles, trailers were impacted by the overcautiousness of distributors due to the weak traffic in sales outlets. Trailer sales were down 8.7% at constant perimeter. <br />
Camping (+61.8%) and garden (+1.7%) equipment activities are in low season and their performance in the quarter is therefore not significant. </p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
<p>First half-year results should be lower than in the previous financial year due to the decline in activity. The modalities of acquisition of SEA should lead to a profit (negative goodwill) that will be included in the first half-year income statement in accordance with IFRS 3. <br />
In a still uncertain European economic context, Trigano will continue its efforts to adapt its organization to the demand evolution and pursue the integration of recent acquisitions.</p>
