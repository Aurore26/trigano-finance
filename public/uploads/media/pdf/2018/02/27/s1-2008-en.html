<p class="exergue">Leisure vehicles</p>
<p>Activity in the fi rst half-year was marked in particular by the absorption of motor caravan
excess stocks built up by dealers at the end of last season. Additionally, the return to normal
production conditions in all business units allowed the delivery of showroom models on a
regular basis, contrary to the previous fi nancial year that was marked by important shifts from
Q1 to Q2.</p>
<p>All things considered, motor-caravan sales increased by 4.5% (+5.6% at constant exchange
rates).</p>
<p>Caravan and Accessories for leisure vehicles sales are overall stable, while those of static
caravans posted a good increase (+31.5%).</p>

<p class="exergue">Leisure equipment</p>
<p>Garden (+10.4%) and Camping equipment (+11.5%) activities are in low season, their good
performance in the fi rst half-year is therefore not signifi cant.</p>
<p>Trailer sales (+10.0%) remain well oriented, particularly in the professional segment.</p>

<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
<p>Thanks to the good orientation of the major markets in the fi rst half-year (except Italy), to the
improvement of production conditions and to the confi rmation of Eura Mobil’s recovery, Trigano
expects to reach 1 billion euros sales in 2007/2008 and should improve its results starting
this year.</p>
