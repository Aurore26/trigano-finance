<p>Thanks to the good level of demand and the gradual increase in  motorhomes production capacity, Trigano&rsquo;s sales were up 22.7% at constant  perimeter. Results benefited from this increase in activity, from cost control &nbsp;and from a further improvement in productivity.  Personnel costs (+21.2%) and external charges (+19.0%) grew at a much slower  pace than sales (+29.6%). Current operating profit reached &euro;148.5 M, up 48.3% compared  to the previous financial year.<br>
  The full consolidation of Auto-Sleepers  Investments led to the revaluation in the amount of 17,8 M&euro; (recognised in  other operating income) of the stake previously held by Trigano, based on the  fair value at 3rd January 2017. <br>
  The financial result includes exchange gains  and the revaluation of minority interest acquisition debts recognised as  financial charges.<br>
  Given the positive contribution of equity  affiliates (&euro;3,4 M), net profit reached &euro;126.9 M, or &euro;6.63 per share (+41.6%).<br>
  Cash flow stood at &euro;161.3 M, an increase of  41.9% compared to 2015/2016. It was notably used to finance capital  expenditures for an amount of &euro;42.0 M, to pay the dividend of &euro;19.2 M and to  strengthen the financial structure despite the increase in working capital due  to the surge in activity.<br>
Trigano entered the 2017/18 fiscal year with a  consolidated net equity of &euro;591.8 M and a net cash position of &euro;82.6 M.</p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
<p>The growth of the motorhome market&nbsp;  in Europe is expected to continue in the short and medium terms. Indeed,  some European markets are still behind their levels of 2007 or 2008 despite the  growth in their customer base for demographic reasons, moreover, recent used  motorhomes (under &nbsp;7 years) available on  the market, main competitors of new motorhomes, are few because of the drastic  reductions of production of new vehicles during the last decade&nbsp;; finally,  the &laquo;&nbsp;van&nbsp;&raquo;, which completes the traditional offer of products and is  aimed at a new clientele that is both younger and older, is experiencing a strong  development that should continue for several years.</p>
<p>Trigano will continue to implement a policy of conquering market shares  across all European markets. This policy will be facilitated by the integration  of Adria Mobil &nbsp;which has a strong  position in Scandinavia and homogenous locations in all other European  countries.</p>
<p>In parallel, during the next financial year, Trigano will focus  on&nbsp;: </p>
<ul>
  <li>improving the productivity of all its plants through capital expenditure  but also by modernising production management methods&nbsp;;</li>
  <li>implementing the integration of Adria which should generate cost  reductions of components used by this new subsidiary and in the longer term  industrial synergies&nbsp;;</li>
</ul>
<p>The continuation of Trigano&rsquo;s ambitious investment program will be  ensured by company&rsquo;s resources and the sale in the short or medium term of all  or part of &nbsp;treasury shares held by the  company which represent around &nbsp;0.95 % of  its share capital.</p>
<p class="exergue">Dividend</p>
<p>The Executive Board will propose to the General Meeting scheduled for 8  January 2018 the payment of a dividend in the amount of &euro; 1.30 per share. </p>
