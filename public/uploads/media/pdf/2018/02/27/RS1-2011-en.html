<br/>
<p>In addition to the  improvement of gross margin linked to the increase in sales, half-year results  benefited from:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>an improvement of the  absorption of fixed manufacturing costs due to the increase in the production of  leisure vehicles</li>
      <li>an increase in margin rates</li>
      <li>the benefits of the  indirect cost reduction actions implemented in the recent months</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thanks to a decrease in interest expense (&euro;-1.4 M) and to an increase in  foreign exchange results (&euro;+1.0 M), the financial result improved by &euro;2.6 M.  Considering a corporate tax expense of &euro;4.6 M (&euro;0.9M tax income in 2010) and  the positive contribution of Loisirs Finance (&euro;0.9 M), the net consolidated  result stood at &euro;9.6 M (loss of &euro;3.2 M in 2010). </p>
    <p>Additionally, half-year accounts recorded a further improvement of  Trigano&rsquo;s financial structure: net financial debt, traditionally at its highest  level as at 28 February reached &euro;55.3 M (&euro;87.3 M as at 28 February 2010),  representing only 17.8% of equity despite the implementation this year of a  policy of early payment in favour of a number of suppliers.</p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
	<p>Thanks to market share gains in leisure vehicles, trailers and garden  equipment, the increase in Trigano&rsquo;s business activity should continue at the  same pace during the second semester and therefore generate a significant improvement  of the results. <br />
    With its low indebtedness and its high level of equity (&euro;309.6 M as at 28  February 2011) Trigano will pursue its investments, including possibly external growth,  in order to increase its market shares in Europe in its strategic activities  (leisure vehicles, trailers) that benefit from structurally favourable fundamentals  and from the solid demographic trend of its customer base. </p>
