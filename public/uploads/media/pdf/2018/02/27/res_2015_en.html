<p>The results for the year benefited from the good level  of activity and from effects of restructuring programmes implemented during the  previous fiscal year. Luano Camp (Rimor motorhomes), acquired in March 2015, contributed  sales of &euro;19.9 M and generated a small profit.</p>
<p> The confirmation of the recovery of SEA, a company  acquired in 2013, led, in accordance with accounting standards, to a deferred  tax asset of &euro;11.2 M corresponding to a part of the tax loss carry-forwards of  this company. The tax charge for the year has been reduced to &euro;4.0 M.</p>
<p> Given the positive contribution of equity affiliates (&euro;4.2  M), net profit reached &euro;59.5 M for the year.</p>
<p> Cash flow stood at &euro;76.4 M, an increase of 86.5% compared  to 2013/2014. It was used to finance capital expenditures for an amount of &euro;15.7  M, to pay the dividend of &euro;5,8 M and to strengthen the financial structure whilst  working capital requirement remained stable. Trigano moves into 2016 with a  consolidated net equity of &euro;421.4 M and a net cash position of &euro;39.7 M. </p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
<p>A further activity growth is expected for 2015/2016. The  strong increase of orders received by distribution networks is driven by the  observed recovery of the European motorhome market and by a positive reception  of our products by consumers.</p>
<p> Trigano has invested to meet this demand especially by  increasing the production capacities of McLouis, Elnagh and Forster brands with  the new plant of Montone and by implementing a new assembly line for Challenger  and Chausson products in Tournon-sur-Rh&ocirc;ne. This policy will be pursued with  the expansion of the sites of Grimsby, Pe&ntilde;iscola, Brant&ocirc;me and Panissi&egrave;res in  the next two years.</p>
<p> Other improvement and investment programmes which may  include external growth will be initiated in order to gain market shares in Europe,  to make the company more competitive and flexible, and to further enhance  profitability.</p>
<p class="exergue">Dividend</p>

<p>The board of directors will propose to the General  Meeting scheduled for 5 January 2016 the payment of a dividend in the amount of  &euro;0.70 per share.</p>
