<p>In addition to the decrease  in gross margin generated by the decrease in sales, annual accounts recorded: </p>
<ul>
  <li>an erosion of the margin rate due to an unfavourable mix and to  operations aimed at promoting sales in order to gain market shares, </li>
  <li>a decrease in productive hours leading to a lesser absorption of  indirect charges of production,</li>
  <li>costs linked to the adjustment of production capacities in some business  units. </li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the decrease of  interest charges (&euro;-0.6 M), net financial charges increased slightly (&euro;+0.3 M)  due to the absence of positive exchange result (&euro;+0.9 M in 2010/2011).</p>
<p>Considering a corporate tax  expense of &euro;11.2 M and the contribution of Loisirs Finance to the results (&euro;2.0  M), the net consolidated result stood at &euro;14.5 M. </p>
<p>Shareholder&rsquo;s equity  increased to &euro;328.0 M as of 31 August 2012 (&euro;324.6 M as of 31 August 2011) and  net debt reached &euro;24.4 M, representing 7.4 % of shareholder&rsquo;s equity. </p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
<p>In a difficult economic environment, and despite the good reception of  the new ranges of vehicles by distributors, the leisure vehicle shows that were  held this Autumn in all Europe, have recorded results that were down compared  to last year. <br />
The markets of Trigano will have to face difficulties, linked in  particular to the austerity measures implemented by several governments of the  European Union, and Trigano will intensify its actions aiming at controlling  working capital requirements and reducing overhead costs.<br /> 
Trigano  will also pursue actively its policy of gaining market shares, including  through external growth.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors will propose to the  General meeting scheduled for 8 January 2013 not to proceed with the payment of  a dividend for the 2012 financial year. </p>
