<p>During the first quarter of the financial year, Trigano pursued its policy of strict alignment of
production with the demand of its dealer networks.</p>
<p class="exergue">Leisure vehicles</p>
<p>The fi rst signs of recovery of sales to consumers perceived on the French and British markets
  have allowed to record growth in sales of motor-caravans from the month of November. German,
  Italian and Scandinavian markets remained depressed. On the quarter, motor-caravan sales
  still show a decrease of 4.9%.<br />
  Sales of caravans came back to a normal level and increased by 19.0%.<br />
  The 36.5% decrease in sales of static caravans (representing &euro; -0,8 M)  is due to the mobilization of the production
  means for the manufacturing of series to be delivered from January 2010.
  Lastly, sales of accessories for leisure vehicles were back to growth (+6.7%), also confirming the harbingers of a
return to confidence in dealer networks.</p>
<p class="exergue">Leisure equipment</p>
      <p>Trailer sales (-20.8%) have been impacted by the implementation of the LME law in France,
        that led distributors to postpone a large part of their pre-season orders, and by the loss of a
        trailer market in Germany.<br />
        Camping equipment (+20.3%) and Garden equipment activities (+6.3%) are in low season,
      and their performance is therefore not significant.</p>
      <p class="exergue">Financial situation</p>
      <p>The first quarter saw the confirmation of the improvement of the group&rsquo;s financial structure,
        thanks to the programs implemented during the previous financial year. In particular, the
        stocks level was again reduced (&euro; -20 M) and therefore contributed to limit the level of net
      debt at &euro; 108 M as at November 30, 2009 (&euro; 253 M as at November 30, 2008).</p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
      <p>The good perception of the 2010 motor-caravan ranges by consumers and the return of dealer
        networks stocks to a normal level account for the high level of the order book at the end
        of November. The ramp-up of manufacturing from January 2010 is expected to lead to a
        significant increase in sales for the remainder of the year.<br />
