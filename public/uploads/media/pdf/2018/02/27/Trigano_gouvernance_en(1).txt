<p class="exergue">Improvement of the governance of Trigano</p>

<p>The Board of Directors has  decided to summon an Extraordinary General Assembly on 26th July 2016 so as to  submit an amendment to the statutes in order to adopt the corporate form of  a limited company governed by a Management Board and a Supervisory Board. This  will allow a better separation between management and control functions of the  company.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors will  propose to the General Meeting the appointment of Mrs Alice Cavalier Feuillet,  Mrs S&eacute;verine Feuillet, Mr Guido Carissimo and Mr Jean-Luc G&eacute;rard as Supervisory  Board members. The Board of Directors will recommend to the Supervisory Board  the appointment of Board members exercising General Management functions at the  Management Board (Mr Fran&ccedil;ois Feuillet, Mrs Marie-H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Feuillet and Mr Michel  Freiche) and Mr Paolo Bicci, currently Head of the Italian pole of Trigano.</p>
