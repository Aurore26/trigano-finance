<p class="exergue">Acquisition of SEA Group</p>
<p>Trigano announces the acquisition of  100% of the capital and the financial debt of SEA Group, Italian manufacturer  of motor caravans based in Poggibonsi in the Siena province.</p>
<p> SEA employs 365 persons and sold  about 3,200 motor caravans in 2012 under the brands McLouis, Elnagh and  Mobilvetta for total sales of &euro;130 M. The group has been in difficulties since 2006,  due mainly to the decrease of the Italian motor caravan market, a very high  debt level with unfavourable financial terms and management instability.</p>
<p> In addition to the reinforcement of  Trigano&rsquo;s market shares, this acquisition will allow to generate several  synergies (purchasing, manufacturing, commercial) that should more than offset  the current operating losses of SEA. <br />
The impact of this operation on net  consolidated debt is estimated at about &euro;15 M.</p>
<p> The acquisition of SEA, which closing  is subject to the agreement of the German and Italian competition authorities, is  part of Trigano&rsquo;s strategy of development through external growth in the fields  of leisure vehicles, accessories for leisure vehicles and trailers.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
