      <p class="exergue">2005 sales: 786.8 &euro;M (+ 12.1%)</p>
      <p>The 4th quarter sales are lower than the forecast because of a decrease of consumption in France, concerning in particular trailers and garden equipment and a timing difference of motor caravans deliveries due to specific problems of supply of new components for the 2006 ranges.</p>

        <p class="exergue">Leisure vehicles (86.1 % of total sales)</p>
        <p>
        <ul><li>Sales of <strong>motor caravans </strong> have reached 522.4 &euro;M (+14.4%). The organic growth (5.2%) was undervalued by difficulties related to the late final choice of some components in three business units. Sales thus shifted over the first quarter of the following fiscal year amount to around 10 &euro;M (approximately 300 vehicles concerned).</li>
            <li>Sales of other leisure vehicles are in slight progression (+2.3%), the decrease of folding and static caravans being more than compensated by the good performance of the <strong>touring caravans </strong> (+9.2 %).</li>
            <li>Sales of accessories for leisure vehicles </strong> reach 71.7 &euro;M (+9.4%). This increase is mainly due to the integration of Camping Profi (n&deg;3 in Germany ) acquired in February 2005.</li>

        </p>
        
        <p class="exergue">Leisure equipment (13.9 % of total sales)</p>
        <p>This activity was particularly affected by the low level of consumption in the 4th quarter and by the lack of military orders.
        <ul><li>Sales of <strong>Garden equipment </strong> decreased by 8.3% and represent only 4.3% of the consolidated sales.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the successful integration of Mecanorem and in spite of a disappointing performance in the 4th quarter (-6.1% within constant perimeter), sales of <strong>Trailers </strong> show a strong increase: +29.5% (+10.4% within constant perimeter).</li>

        <p class="exergue">OUTLOOK</p>
        <p>Strengthened by the acquisition of Eura Mobil and confirmed in its choices by the favorable welcome to its new products (motor caravans and caravans) initially by its distribution networks then on the first shows by the end customers, Trigano will continue to benefit from the dynamism unceasingly renewed of the motor caravans market in Europe (+9.8% over the period September  - June 2005) to continue its growth and to improve its profitability. </p>
