      <p class="exergue">Leisure vehicles (88.1% of total sales: +7.3%)</p>
      <p>The good conditions of manufacturing of the fi rst 2008 models enabled Trigano to sell close to 20,000 motor caravans in 2006/2007. The progress of sales in Italy, Spain and Belgium more than offsets the decline in the United Kingdom linked to the late introduction by car manufacturers of right-hand drive wheel bases.<br />
        Sales of touring caravans (+10.1%) and of accessories (+16.2% of which +4.2% organic) are also well
      oriented.</p>
      
      	<p class="exergue">Leisure equipment (11.9% of total sales: +5.9%)</p>
        <p>Garden and Camping equipment activities, currently in restructuring, have been impacted by poor weather conditions and posted sales decreases of 6.0% and 1.7% respectively.<br>
        Driven notably by the development of sales in the German and Polish markets, the Trailers activity (+13.4% in 2006/2007) has pursued its progression to reach 110,000 units sold.</p>      
        <p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
        <p>The additional costs entailed by the production of motor caravans on the new wheel bases particularly in the business units manufacturing top-of-the-range vehicles, as well as a less favourable country mix in terms of margins, are leading Trigano to expect for the 2006/2007 fiscal year a current operating income between 6 and 7% of total sales.</p>
        
        <p>The continuation of favourable trends on the European market of motor caravans, the positive  reception of new models, the ramp up of the new production lines and the expected recovery of Eura Mobil&rsquo;s results should allow Trigano to improve substantially its results from the 2007/2008 fiscal year.</p>
