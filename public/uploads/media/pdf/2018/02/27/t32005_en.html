        <p>The third quarter sales of <strong>Leisure vehicles </strong> grew by 16.1% thanks in particular to the integration of Eura Mobil. The markets remain well oriented except for top-of-the-range segment on which Trigano has a small market share. The organic growth of the activity has however slowed down because:
        <ul><li>of a number of wrought days lower than that of last year,</li>
            <li>a lack of growth in accessories business,</li>
            <li>the implementation of programmes of increase in the production capacities for the next season.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>The sales of <strong>Leisure equipment </strong> increased by 8.1% in the third quarter. The trailers business confirmed its net restarting: +33.2% (+15.1% within a comparable perimeter). On the other hand, the garden equipment activity was strongly affected by the low level of consumption in France.</p>
        
        <p>The new ranges of caravans and motor caravans presented to the distribution networks in June got a particularly good reception: the orders of show models are in clear progression compared to last year and new distributors were recruited. </p>
        
        <p>n spite of the difficulties encountered in garden equipment, Trigano is confident in its ability to reach in 2005 a sales figure of M&euro; 800. The good course of the integration of Eura Mobil makes it possible to confirm an EBIT margin close to 10.5% of the sales. </p>
