      <p class="exergue">2006 yearly results</p>
      <p>Significant events marked the financial year ending August 31, 2006 :
      <ul>
        <li>the change in chassis, used as base vehicle for motor caravans, carried out simultaneously by two car manufacturers,</li>
        <li>shifts in the profitability improvement programme deployed by Eura Mobil and by some Business Units involved in the upper segment of the motor caravan market,</li>
        <li>the worsening of the difficulties encountered by the garden equipment activity.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>The knock-on effect of these items on the results did not allow Trigano to meet the year-end profit targets. Driven by the Leisure Vehicles activity (+13.4% of which a 8.7% organic growth), the consolidated turnover increased however by 11.0% and eventually reached &euro;872.5m.</p>

      <p class="noteTable">Estimated results: non audited figures</p>
      <p>The consolidated  operating profit before non recurrent items amounts to &euro;69.0m and  accounts for 7.9% of the turnover (9.9% in 2005). The profitability was  inhibited in particular by the disturbances entailed by the introduction of the  new base vehicles, by a less favourable sales mix (country/products) compared  with the previous financial year and by the deteriorating results of the garden  equipment activity. Conversely, both activities of accessories trade and trailers  manufacturing outperformed.<br>
        The  improvement of the financial structure resulted in a decrease in the interest  charges : the financial result (&euro;-3.3m) increased by &euro;0.7m.<br>
      Considering a corporate tax expense of &euro;23.8m and taking  into account the contribution of Loisirs Finance to the consolidated results up  to &euro;1.1m, the net income eventually amounts to &euro;42.6m (&euro;48.4m in 2005).</p>
      
      <p >These results are beneficial to a reinforcement of the  consolidated shareholders&rsquo; equity which reaches &euro;297.4m (&euro;265.6m in 2005).The  financial structure remains particularly strong&nbsp;: the net financial debt (&euro;46.4m)  accounts for only 15.6% of the shareholders&rsquo; equity (21.9% in 2005).</p>
      
      <p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
      <p>The  main operating markets of Trigano still benefit from a bright outlook, which  will be instrumental in a sustained growth of the activity.</p>
      <p>Despite the impact on the first quarter sales of  the difficulties resulting from the introduction of the new base vehicles for  motor caravans, Trigano forecasts a turnover of &euro;940m for 2007.</p>
      <p>The Trigano strategy is based on the programme  of increase in the production capacity of leisure vehicles and on the  deployment of the matrix organisation enabling an expansion of the ranges for  each brand along with significant productivity gains.</p>
      <p>The  Board of Directors will submit to the General meeting scheduled for January 8th,  2007 the payment of a dividend of &euro; 0.55 per share (+10%)</p>
