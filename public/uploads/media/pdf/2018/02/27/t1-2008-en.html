      <p>Sales of motor caravans posted a strong increase  (+16.0%): the improved manufacturing conditions of show models, that were affected  at the beginning of the previous financial year by insufficient availability of  wheel bases and components, allowed the delivery of showroom models to the dealers  network in adequate quantities.</p>
      <p>Sales of touring caravans (+1.9%), of accessories for  leisure vehicles (+8.0% of which 4.1% organic), and of static caravans (+84.5%)  are also well oriented. </p>
      
      <p class="exergue">Leisure equipment</p>
      <p>Given that camping equipment (+62.1%) and Garden  equipment (-0.1%) activities are in low season, their performance in the first  quarter is therefore not significant. Sales of trailers (+14.5%) maintain a  strong growth pace, as in the previous season. </p>
      <p>Additionally, Trigano&rsquo;s activity in the 2008 first  quarter has had no substantial impact on its financial structure. </p>
      
      <p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
      <p>After a promising start of financial year,  Trigano maintains its sales target for 2008 (1 billion euros, +7.0%). In  parallel, profitability should be enhanced thanks to the increase of the  activity, to the improvement of productivity and to the non-recurrence of issues  that affected the 2007 financial year. </p>
