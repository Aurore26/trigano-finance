</table>
<p>Current operating result reached &euro;52.5 M (+39.6%) in the first  half-year, representing 7.0% of sales (6.1% in 2015/2016). Half-year results  benefited from the strong growth in activity, the improved productivity on most  of sites and from the restrained rise of operating expenses. They were  constrained due to recurrent problems in chassis delivery and to the  depreciation of the Sterling Pound against the Euro, which could not be passed  on in its entirety to sales prices in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The full consolidation of Auto-Sleepers Investments led to reassess by &euro;  17,8M (recognised under other operating income) the interest, previously held  by Trigano, on the basis of fair value as of 3rd January 2017. </p>
<p>Financial result was &euro;-1.7 M (&euro;+1.5 M in 2015/16). Cost of financial  debt (&euro;1.0 M) is stable, but currency results were significantly down (&euro;-0.4 M against  &euro;+2.4 M in the first half-year 2015/16) due to the unfavourable trend in the  Sterling Pound. </p>
<p>Considering corporate tax expense of &euro;13.6 M and the positive contribution  of equity affiliates (2,0 M&euro;), the net consolidated result stood at&nbsp; &euro;56.6 M (+77.5% in comparison with 2015/16) and  represents &euro;2.93 per share. </p>
<p>Furthermore, thanks to an effective management of the seasonal change in  working capital requirements and despite the high level of capital expenditure (&euro;20.9  M in comparison to &euro; 11.5 M in 2016), net debt, traditionally at its high level  at the end of the first half-year, reached &euro;24.0 M (&euro;31.5 M in 2016), representing  4.5% of equity (7.2% in 2016).</p>
<p>Finally, Trigano continues to implement its capital expenditure  programme aiming at satisfying the growing demand, strengthening the  competitiveness of the company and improving its profitability and working  conditions. This programme focuses on 11 industrial sites, it should be fully  deployed at the end of the financial year 2018.</p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
	<p>The high level of  motorhomes order backlog points to a sustained activity in the second half-year  ; this increase will be achieved by a progressive and significant rise in production  capacities and the return to normal chassis deliveries.</p>
