<p class="exergue">Leisure Vehicles</p>
<p>The increase in the number of signs detrimental to consumption (inflation, decrease in purchasing power, rise in energy prices, increase in interest rates) has not favoured, all over Europe, the traffic in sales outlets in the third quarter and led distributors to substantially reduce their purchases. In this difficult context, unlike some of its competitors, Trigano chose not to overload its distribution networks by implementing significant discounts or exceptional payment conditions. As a consequence, the sales of motor caravans in the third quarter are down compared to the same period last year (-17.1%). The difficulties in the quarter have also impacted the sales of accessories for leisure vehicles (-9.4%) and, to a lesser extent, the sales of caravans (-3.5%). On the other hand, the deliveries of static caravans increased (+10.0%). </p>

<p class="exergue">Leisure Equipment</p>
<p>Thanks to the growth in trailer sales (+10.1%), the leisure Equipment activity remains well oriented. Impacted by poor weather conditions, Camping equipment activity posted a decline (-9.6% in Q3) while Garden equipment remains on good dynamics (+3.5%) thanks to a regained competitiveness. </p>

<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
<p>The slowdown in the leisure vehicles activity observed since the beginning of the second half-year will weigh on the level of the 2008 sales and results. The high level of stock of motor caravans will not allow the reduction of working capital requirements in the financial year. Despite a good welcome of the 2009 product range by distribution networks, Trigano has taken measures to adapt its production capacities and initiated measures to reinforce its commercial dynamics. </p>
<p>In the medium term, Trigano’s activity remains driven by deep-seated demographical and sociological trends (growth of the senior population and pronounced interest for active leisure in Europe). It should thus logically not be durably impacted by the sluggishness of consumption in Europe.
