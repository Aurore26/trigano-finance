      <p>2008/2009 Half-Year Sales: &euro;304.5 M </p>
<p>Trigano sales decreased in the first half-year, due to the decision of distributors to strongly reduce their stocks, owing to the tightening of bank credit and to economic crisis-related uncertainties.</p>

<p>In a context of moderate decline of the motor caravan market in Europe (the two main markets, France and Germany, declined by 12.4% and 13.6% respectively on the 6 month-period ending February 28<sup>th</sup>), distributors reduced their show models, cut most of their pre-season orders and strictly limited the sales of vehicles with trade-in. Trigano sales of motor caravans thus decreased by 40.5%, but its share of the main European markets did not fall. Despite the low level of sales, Trigano reduced its stocks of motor caravans by about 1,000. <br />
  Caravans (-21.1%) and accessories (-21.2%) sales were also affected, but to a lesser extent. <br />
In opposition, sales of static caravans remained on a good trend (+29.6%), which is atypical in an overall depressed market.</p>

      <p>Distributors destocking also impacted the trailers activity, which sales decreased by 24.7% in the first half-year. Garden (-16.4%) and camping equipment (-15.4%) sales, although not significant in this period due to the strong seasonality of sales, also reflect a decline in pre-season orders and the postponement of certain commercial operations by the large-scale distribution.<br />
      </p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
      <p>Thanks to its high level of equity (more than &euro;300M as of 31 August 2008) and to its responsive organisation, Trigano is well-equipped to go through the crisis. In the second half-year, the company will pursue its efforts to adapt to the current economic environment. In particular, new measures of indirect cost cutting will be implemented. The stock reduction objective of &euro;60M should be reached before the end of the financial year. <br />
