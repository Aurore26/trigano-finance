<p>* : change in sales after deduction of Auto-Sleepers&rsquo;  contribution, fully consolidated since 1 January 2017</p>
<p class="exergue">Leisure vehicles</p>
<p>Thanks to the good level of demand and to the gradual increase in  production capacities enabled by investment programmes initiated in the past  two years, <strong>motorhomes </strong>sales increased  by 29.0% in the second quarter (25.9% at constant perimeter). This growth was  slowed down by the impossibility to fully exploit the increase in production  capacity, as a result of the insufficient ramp-up of chassis deliveries by car  manufacturers.<br>
<strong>Static caravans</strong> (+26.6%) and <strong>caravans</strong> sales  (+13.1% at constant perimeter) benefitted from the positive momentum of the  market.</p>
<p class="exergue">Leisure equipment</p>
<p><strong>Trailers </strong>activity  remained well oriented with 7.9% sales growth in the second quarter. <strong>Camping equipment</strong> (+28.7%) and <strong>garden equipment </strong>(-7.5%) are in low  season and their evolutions in Q2 are therefore not significant.</p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
<p>The renewed confidence of leisure vehicles customers  in Europe, the development of the vans segment and the success of Trigano  products led to an increase in order backlog which points to a strong sales  increase in the second half-year.</p>
<p>In the short and medium term, Trigano will pursue  investment programmes in physical and human capital in order to better serve  its customers, to further improve product quality and to consolidate its profitability.</p>
