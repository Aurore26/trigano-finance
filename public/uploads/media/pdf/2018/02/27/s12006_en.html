      <p class="noteTable">non definitive figures - not audited</p>
      <p>The first-half sales figure is well ahead of forecasts due to the strong increase in the leisure vehicles activity.</p>
      <p>Within constant perimeter, the sales of motor caravans increased by 16.8%, which strengthens the position of Trigano on a still well-oriented European market. Touring (+10.4%) and static (+180%) caravans as well as the accessories trade activity (+8.4%) also show significant rates of growth. Conversely, sales of awnings and trailer tents are down, owing to decreasing UK and Dutch markets for these products.</p>
      <p>The Leisure equipment activity made up lost ground thanks to the delivery of tents for the Army initially scheduled for the first quarter. Sales of trailers (+1.0%) are in slight progression compared with last year, period during which sales had been boosted by anticipated purchases for fear of a raise of the steel prices. Sales of garden equipment are down 11.8%.</p>
      <p class="exergue">Significant events</p>
      <p>The financial year ending August 31, 2006 will be disclosed according to IFRS standards. Restatements on turnover are not material. They deal with the discount for early payments, the booking of allowances paid to distributors as well as gaps in the generating fact of sales for some products.</p>
      <p>A staggered strike has affected the factory of Tournon-sur-Rh&ocirc;ne from February 9th to March 16th.<br>
        A settlement was reached with trade-union organizations. The catching up, during the third quarter, of output lost due to this dispute is an integral part of this agreement.</p>
        
      <p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
      <p>The continuing growth of the leisure vehicles markets in Europe, the significant level of order books and the taking off of the Peniscola and Sabl&eacute;-sur-Sarthe plants should enable Trigano to achieve a turnover higher than &euro;880m for 2006.<br>
