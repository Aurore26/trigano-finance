<p class="exergue">Leisure Vehicles</p>
<p>In the third quarter, sales of motor-caravans (+22.2%) and touring caravans (+19.3%) confirm
  their favourable momentum and those of static caravans (-1.0%) have almost reached the high
  level recorded last year.<br />
  Good growth in sales of accessories (+10.2%) reflects the improvement of traffic in leisure
vehicle sales outlets.</p>

<p class="exergue">Leisure Equipment</p>
<p>Leisure equipment activity remains on the whole affected by the weakness of consumption.<br />
  Sales of trailers are stable (-0.2%) while those of camping equipment are down (-9.4%).
  Thanks to the development of internet sales, garden equipment displays in this context an
atypical increase of 6.4%.</p>

<p class="exergue">Financial situation</p>
<p>Third quarter results reinforce the forecast of a return to profit from the current financial year.
  The conjunction of recovering profitability and of the continued reduction in working capital
  requirements supported a further reinforcement of Trigano&rsquo;s financial structure. In particular,
  net debt that reached about &euro;150 M as of 31 May 2009 has been reduced to zero as of
31 May 2010.</p>

<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
<p>The clearly positive reception by distribution networks of the new caravan and motor-caravan
  ranges, resolutely innovative, should allow for the continuation of sales growth and an improved
  profitability in 2010/2011. The positioning of Trigano compared to its competition should also
result in the gain of new market shares particularly in the field of motor-caravan.</p>
