<p>Leisure vehicles</p>
<p>The leisure vehicles activity confirmed its favourable momentum. Sales  of motor-caravans (+12.5%) and caravans (+7.9%) have been driven by the success  of 2011 ranges, despite the disruptions caused by the national social movements  that affected the French production units and limited production volumes below forecasts.<br />
The deliveries of static caravans (&euro;1.4 M) remained stable compared to  the first quarter of last year, while the level of accessories sales (-3.7%) do  not allow in the low season to have an indication on the evolution in the full year. </p>
<p class="exergue">Leisure equipment</p>
      <p>The trailers activity (-13.1%) was affected by a decrease in traditional  pre-season billings. Due to the implementation of LME law that reduces the  terms of payment, distributors postponed part of their orders to the end of  winter. Camping equipment (+22.0%) and garden equipment (+20.1%) activities are  in low season, and their performance is therefore not significant.</p>
      <p class="exergue">Financial situation</p>
      <p>Trigano&amp;rsquo;s activity in the first quarter has had no significant impact on  its financial structure. In particular, the continuation of the actions to control  the evolution of working capital requirements as well as the improvement of the  results allowed containing the level of net debt at about &euro;17 M (&euro;108 M as of  30 November 2009). </p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
      <p>The ramp-up of manufacturing in order to meet the increasing demand of leisure  vehicles should translate into an acceleration of sales growth in the coming  months. The order book in volume terms at end November remains strong (+23.4%  in motor-caravans and +4,9% in caravans compared to 2010). This increase in activity  combined with the improvement of productivity linked to the increase in the  size of production lots, should lead to an improvement of the results in 2011.</p>
