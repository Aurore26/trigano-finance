<p>Leisure vehicles</p>
<p>In an economic context marked by a wait-and-see attitude from end customers, leisure vehicles activity is up 2.4% and shows contrasted trends. Motor caravan sales, up 4.0%, pursue their growth in the first quarter, while those of caravans are down 9.4%. Accessories sales resisted well and recorded 2.9% growth. </p>
<p class="exergue">Leisure equipment</p>
      <p>Leisure equipment activity is stable compared to last year. Trailer sales recorded a good growth in the quarter (+11.4%) reflecting the success of Trigano's products. Camping equipment (-32.5%) and garden equipment (-14.3%) activities are in low season and their performance is therefore not significant.</p>
<p class="exergue">Financial situation</p>
      <p>Trigano's activity in the first quarter has had no significant impact on its financial structure. </p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
      <p>In a context of weak recovery of consumption in Europe, Trigano will remain watchful to the changes in the economic environment while pursuing actively its efforts to increase and consolidate its positions on its markets. </p>
