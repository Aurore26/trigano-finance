*&nbsp;: change in sales  after deduction of Auto-Sleepers&rsquo; contribution, fully consolidated since 1st January 2017
<p class="exergue">Sales up 27.3  % as at end of May</p>
<p>In the third quarter, Trigano confirmed the rise in its production capacities  and achieved sales of €564.0M (+37.4%).<br>
Over the first nine months, sales reached 1.3 Billion Euros (+27.3%), i.e.  the total sales achieved over the previous financial year.</p>

<p class="exergue"><em>Leisure vehicles: + 43.1%</em></p>
<p>Trigano has again outperformed the <strong>motorhome</strong> market, still well oriented in Europe; sales increased by 47.9% in the third  quarter (34.2% at constant perimeter).<br>
<strong>Caravans </strong>sales<strong> </strong>(+47.4%), boosted by  the integration of the company Auto-Sleepers (United Kingdom), were up by 15.6%  at constant perimeter while <strong>static caravans</strong> sales continued their sustained growth momentum (+38.1% in the third quarter). However,  sales of <strong>accessories for leisure  vehicles</strong> (+2.4%) did not benefit from the markets&rsquo; growth.</p>
<p class="exergue"><em>Leisure equipment&nbsp;: +4.4%</em></p>
<p><strong>Camping equipment</strong> sales (-7.5%) were impacted in the third quarter by a downturn in  deliveries in France due to a high level of stocks at retailers at the  beginning of the season. <strong>Trailers</strong> and <strong>garden equipment </strong>activities experienced  identical sales growth at 6.3% in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
<p>The new motorhome and caravan ranges presented to the  distribution networks in June were well received, which led to a solid order  backlog. </p>
<p>The positive trend of leisure vehicles markets will  allow Trigano to sustain the growth of its activity and results in 2017/2018, despite  adverse effects of the pound sterling depreciation and uncertainties regarding  consumption level in Great Britain subsequent to the launching of the exit  process of the European Union.  </p>
<p>The competition authorities have approved the takeover  of the company Adria by Trigano, allowing considering the finalisation of this  operation in the next months. It is reminded that this acquisition will enable  Trigano to generate strong synergies and to complete its brands portfolio in  order to improve its market shares in areas where the group is less well  represented such as Scandinavia or Germany. </p>
