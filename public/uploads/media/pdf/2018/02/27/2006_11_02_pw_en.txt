<p class="exergue">Trigano reports information about its provisional results for 2006 and displays its confidence for 2007</p>

<p>The operating profit before tax and extraordinary items for the 2005/06 financial year should be close to 8% of the turnover, down by around 10% compared with the previous financial year. Indeed, despite the sustained level of leisure vehicles sales, the profitability was hampered by partly unexpected items:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Group felt the knock-on effects of the advent of the new chassis for  motor caravans (this operation occurs every 10/12 years) which resulted in cost  overruns. The production backlog on new models entailed by the labour unrest in  the plant of Tournon amplified locally the consequences of these disruptions,</li>
    <li>The sales mix of motor caravans per country and per product eventually  turned out to be less favourable than expected, hence a decrease in the  operating profit, </li>
    <li>The start-up of the production plants of Peniscola and Sabl&eacute; entailed  higher costs than anticipated, </li>
    <li>The garden equipment activity had to face up to delays in delivery from  subcontractors which led to turnover losses and the implementation of late  delivery penalties by the large-scale distribution, </li>
    <li>Lesser sales of awnings and trailer tents (-23%) affected by the  downward UK  and Dutch markets resulted in underutilizing some camping equipment  manufacturing plants.</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering that most above-listed  items are non recurrent, the outlook for 2007 remains favourable despite some  persistent production gaps on the first months of the financial year coupled  with the impact of restructuring-related measures which will possibly be  implemented.</p>

<p>The unveiling of the new ranges of  motor caravans gave rise to a warm welcome from the distribution networks and  from the end customers, as confirmed by the autumn exhibitions.</p>

<p>Trigano will stand by its policy of  organic and external growth which should be instrumental, in the medium and  long term, in a significant increase in the sales volume and in the operating  profit. Therefore, the takeover of the second largest UK LV's accessory  specialist has already been concluded (turnover of &pound;7m).</p>

<p>The definitive results for the  2005/06 financial year will be disclosed on November 30, 2006 after closing of  the stock exchange.</p>
