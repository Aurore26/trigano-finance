The sales of vehicles are improving (motor caravans + 9.7 %; touring caravans + 6.3 %) while those of accessories for LVs depend more on the general level of consumers' consumption.</p>
      
      <p>Carried by the trailers sales strong growth (+ 19.9 % within a constant perimeter) and the integration of Mecanorem, the Leisure Equipment activity is also in progress, in spite of the lack of military tent orders.</p>
      
      <p class="exergue">2005 PROSPECTS</p>
