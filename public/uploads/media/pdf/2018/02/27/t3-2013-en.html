<p class="exergue">Leisure Vehicles</p>
<p>The leisure vehicle market remained affected by the economic climate in  Europe and by uncertainties over the future level of retirement incomes.<br />
  Trigano&rsquo;s motor caravan sales are up 27.3% in the third quarter due to  the integration of SEA and Notin. At constant perimeter, the downward trend  seen since the beginning of the financial year has slowed slightly thanks to  the success of &ldquo;Spring&rdquo; series (motor caravans: -8.1% and caravans: -7.0%).<br />
  Sales of accessories for leisure vehicles (-7.3%) have been impacted by  the decrease in consumption.<br />
Deliveries of static caravans have pursued their growth (+16.3%),  confirming the good positioning of Trigano&rsquo;s products on a declining French  market.</p>
<p class="exergue">Leisure Equipment</p>
<p>Thanks to the contribution of Lider and Gaupen Henger, the growth of trailer sales reached 71.5% in the third quarter. At constant perimeter however, sales followed market trend (-7.1%). <br />
Camping Equipment (-5.8%) and Garden Equipment (-13.7%) activities were impacted in the third quarter by unfavorable meteorological conditions in France.</p>
<p class="exergue">Financial situation</p>
<p>Activity in the third quarter has had no significant impact on Trigano's financial situation except the seasonal decrease in working capital requirements and its positive impact on cash situation.</p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
<p>The new ranges of motor caravans and caravans presented to the distributors in June have been well received. Trigano's financial solidity, its rigorous management and sustained adaptation efforts should allow Trigano to pursue the reinforcement of its positions, despite the economic context.</p>
