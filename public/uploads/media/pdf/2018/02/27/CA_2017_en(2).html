<p>Trigano again outperformed the European <strong>motorhome</strong> market with sales up 28.2% at constant perimeter (36.2% integrating  the takeover of Auto-Sleepers). <br>
  <strong>Caravan </strong>sales benefited  from the positive momentum of the market and show growth of 13.7 % at constant  perimeter (+35.9% integrating the takeover of Auto-Sleepers&acute; retail activity). Sales of <strong>accessories for leisure vehicles </strong>remained  stable<strong> </strong>(+2.2%).<br>
<strong>Static caravan</strong> activity performed well with a growth of 32.9% over the financial year.</p>
<p class="exergue">Leisure equipment</p>
<p><strong>Trailers</strong> sales were up  7.4% in 2016/2017 (7.1% at constant perimeter).<br>
<strong>Camping equipment</strong> (+9.6%) and <strong>garden equipment</strong> (+4.7%) activities profited from favourable climatic conditions at the season  peak. </p>
<p class="exergue">Perspectives</p>
<p>The increase in sales to private customers during the first national  shows substantiates the favourable feedback given by the distribution networks  to Trigano&acute;s new ranges of leisure vehicles. The high level of order backlogs, supported  by the confirmation of the good performance of European motorhome markets,  allow considering growth in sales for the financial year 2017/2018.<br>
  The integration of recent acquisitions: Hubi&egrave;re (turnover of 9 M&euro;), French  trailers manufacturer acquired in July 2017; Michael Jordan (turnover of 10 M&pound;),  British dealership of motorhomes and caravans acquired in September 2017 which  will join the Marquis distribution network, and especially Adria shall allow  Trigano to generate many synergies.<br>
Trigano will intensify its gaining market shares policy in Europe by  pursuing its innovation efforts, the development of its distribution networks,  and the enhancing of the competitiveness of its products. Trigano will pursue  its programme to expand production capacity aiming at being able to meet  expected increase in demand.</p>
