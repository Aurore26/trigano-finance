<p class="exergue">Leisure vehicles</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter, motor caravan (+10.7%) and caravan (+4.3%) sales confirmed
the commercial success met by Trigano’s products. Sales of these products are
up 12.6% and 16.1% respectively on a full year basis. Accessories for leisure
vehicle sales are also on a favourable trend (+3.9% for the financial year).<br /> 
After two years of strong growth (+80% in two years) static caravan sales (-9.0%
in the quarter) are up 4.1% on last year’s despite a decrease in non professional
purchases during the last months.</p>

<p class="exergue">Leisure equipment</p>
<p>Boosted by the growth of internet sales, garden equipment activity has pursued its development (+12.0%) and ended the year up 8.5%.<br />
Trailer sales (-4.5% in the financial year) have started their recovery with a fourth quarter (+1.8%) marked by a rebound in the demand of professional trailers. <br />
Camping equipment activity increased slightly in the financial year (+1.9%).</p>

<p class="exergue">Financial situation</p>
<p>Trigano has continued to strengthen its financial structure during the 2010
financial year and ended it with a net cash position. The return to profit coupled
with the efforts to reduce the working capital requirements have indeed led to
an improvement in the cash flow situation by more than 100 M&euro;.</p>

<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
<p>The good reception of the new ranges of vehicles by distributors and by the
public have led to an increase in order books, particularly significant for motor
caravans, and should allow a further increase in sales in 2011. Having demonstrated
its high adaptation capacities and its ability to reinforce its financial structure,
Trigano is particularly well-equipped to make the most of the new prospects offered
by the end of the crisis for leisure vehicles.</p>
