<p class="exergue">Leisure Vehicles</p>
<p>The austerity policies implemented in several  European countries as well as the political uncertainty in France weighed on  the evolution of most leisure vehicle markets in Europe in the third quarter.  The motor-caravan sales of Trigano are down 12.0% (-1.3% over 9 months).Caravan activity was, moreover, affected by heavy destocking by  distributors. Sales are down 32.1% in  the third quarter (-23.0% over 9 months). <br />
Accessories for leisure vehicle sales (+10.6%; -0.3% at constant perimeter) resisted well,  while static caravan deliveries pursued their increase (+14.8% in Q3&nbsp;;  +24.9% over 9 months), thus confirming the ramp-up of Trigano on this market segment.</p>
<p class="exergue">Leisure Equipment</p>
<p>Leisure equipment activity suffered from adverse weather conditions that  affected the sales of camping equipment (+0.7% in Q3; -10.8% over 9 months),  garden equipment (-11.3% in Q3; -12.3% over nine months) and trailers (-9.1% in  Q3; +0.1% over nine months).</p>
<p class="exergue">Financial situation</p>
<p>During the third quarter, Trigano remained particularly attentive to the  evolution of the economic context and rapidly adapted its production in order  to contain the level of its stocks. The company also fully benefitted from the  seasonal decrease of working capital requirements as well as from the profits recorded  as at end of May in order to improve its cash position which is back to a largely positive situation.</p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
<p>The new ranges of motor-caravans and caravans presented to the  distributors in June have been well received. Despite the economic context, the  level of orders as of today is equivalent to that of last year, except from  Southern Europe distributors who reduced the level of their orders, due to  difficulties to find financing for showroom models. <br />
Trigano&rsquo;s financial solidity as well as its rigorous management allow  the company to continue the study of external growth opportunities in order to  pursue the consolidation of its position.</p>
