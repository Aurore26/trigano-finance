</table>
<p>Thanks to the good level of demand in the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium and Spain as well as market share gains, sales of motorhomes recorded a growth of 23.0% in the second quarter. Deliveries of caravans (-12.3%) remained impacted by the poor economic situation in France and Netherlands, and were affected by the wait-and-see attitude of distributors. Despite good growth outside France, sales of accessories for leisure vehicles (-1.6%) were impacted by the sluggishness of consumption on the French market. </p>
<p>Given the seasonality of deliveries, static caravan sales in the second quarter (+24.0%) are not indicative of a trend for the year. In view of the still negative evolution of the French market, annual sales should decrease in comparison to 2013/2014.</p>
<p>Trailers activity remained well oriented with 8.0% sales growth in the second quarter. Camping equipment (-11.7%) and garden equipment (+10.4%) are in low season and their evolutions in Q2 are therefore not significant.</p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
<p>First half-year results should reflect the overall increase in activity and the effects of restructuring programs implemented in 2013/2014.</p>
<p>The high level of motorhomes order backlog points to a sustained activity in the second half-year.</p>
<p>Production capacities will be temporarily adjusted thanks to input of additional workforce and resort to the increase of working hours.</p>
