      <p class="exergue">2007 Annual Results</p>
      <p>The increase in sales volume, thanks to the ramp-up of the Peniscola and Sabl&eacute;-sur-Sarthe motor caravan production plant together with the good performance of the Trailers activity, led to sales growth of 7.1%. </p>
      <p>The non recurrent costs entailed by the production of motor caravans on the new wheel bases have penalised as expected the results of the year.</p>

      <p>The current operating profit has reached &euro; 57.8m,  corresponding to 6.2% of total sales (7.9% in 2006). The results of the Leisure  vehicles activity have been affected essentially by exceptional additional costs  entailed by the manufacturing of motor caravans on the new wheel bases, in  particular at Eura Mobil, Auto-Trail and Autostar, and by a less favourable  country mix in terms of margins. On the other hand, thanks to the beginning of  the recovery of Garden Equipment, the profitability of Leisure Equipment  activity has improved: the sectorial operating profit amounts to 6.3% of total  sales, compared to 3.6% in 2005/2006. </p>
      <p>The increase in interest rates and a higher  utilisation of short term debt, linked to increased working capital  requirements, were detrimental to the financial result of &euro; 2.6m. </p>
      <p>Considering a corporate tax expense of &euro; 22.1m and  taking into account the contribution of Loisirs Finance up to &euro;1.2m, the net  consolidated income amounts to &euro;31.3m (&euro;42.6 in 2006). </p>
      <p>These results  are beneficial to a reinforcement of the consolidated shareholders&rsquo; equity  which reached &euro;316.1m (&euro;297.2m in 2006). The financial structure remains  particularly solid: the net financial debt (&euro;76.2m as of 31 August 2007)  accounts only for 24.1% of the shareholders&rsquo; equity (15.6% as of 31 August  2006). </p>
      
      <p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
      <p>The favourable  trends of Trigano&rsquo;s markets should allow a sustained growth of the activity in  the coming years. The continuation of the programme of production capacity  increases and the intensification of the matrix organisation implementation will  continue to bear fruit. </p>
      <p>Thanks to these  elements, Trigano expects to reach 1 billion euros sales and to substantially improve  its results starting in 2008. </p>      <p>The Board of  Directors will submit to the General meeting scheduled for 8 January 2008 the  payment of a dividend of &euro;0.55 per share. </p>
