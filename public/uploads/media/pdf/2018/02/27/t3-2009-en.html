<p class="exergue">Leisure Vehicles</p>
<p>The European market of leisure vehicles fell back again in the third quarter, with some signs of improvement nonetheless in France and Germany in April and May. In that context, distributors continued to reduce their number of vehicles on site. Sales of motor caravans (-30.1%) and caravans (-22.0%) are down, but all the same Trigano maintains its market shares in main countries in terms of registrations. Sales of accessories (-14.9%) were affected by the low turnout in outlets, but do not seem to be impacted anymore by destocking operations.
In opposition, sales of static caravans remained on a good trend (+36.7%).</p>

<p class="exergue">Leisure Equipment</p>
<p>Distributors destocking also impacted the trailers activity, which sales decreased by 26.8% in the third quarter. Garden (-2.9%) and camping equipment (+22.5%) sales on the other hand
resisted very well.</p>

<p class="exergue">Financial situation</p>
<p>Despite the weakness of the activity, the operating result of Trigano is back to profi t in the third quarter. Furthermore, the company pursued with success its efforts to contain its
utilisation of credits. Net fi nancial debt was thus reduced to about € 150 M, which represents an improvement of more than € 100 M compared with the situation as at 02/28/2009. This
outcome could be achieved particularly thanks to a strong decrease in stocks (€ -100 M compared with the opening situation).</p>

<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
<p>In the medium term, the activity of Trigano is still driven by deep-seated demographic and sociological trends. Besides, the motor caravan offers signifi cant economical and environmental
advantages compared with alternative modes of leisure.</p><p>
The warm welcome of the new product ranges by distributors as well as the strong decrease in stocks observed in most sites augur a recovery of sales in the near future. Supported by
its responsive organisation, Trigano will pursue its efforts to adapt to the current economic environment with the implementation, within a short time, of new measures of indirect cost
cutting.</p>
