<p class="exergue">Commercial Activity</p>

<p>On  a <strong>motor  caravan</strong> market expected stable in Europe for the season, Trigano sales showed  9.4% growth in the third quarter, confirming the good dynamics  observed since the beginning of the year. Sales growth as at end of  May reached 16.6% (+6.1% at constant perimeter).</p>
<p><strong>Caravan</strong> sales (-8.0% in the quarter, -3.9% over 9 months) have been impacted  in particular by the decrease of the French and German markets.</p>
<p><strong>Static caravan</strong> deliveries are up 26.2% in the third quarter allowing Trigano to  reduce part of the gap recorded in the first semester. As at end of  May, sales are down 5.3% compared to last year but ahead of  forecasts.</p>
<p>Sales of <strong>accessories  for leisure vehicles</strong> were boosted by market share gains in the UK and recorded 7.1% growth  in the third quarter. They remain well-oriented over nine months  (+3.9%). </p>
<p>Thanks  in particular to the good growth of the Polish business unit, the <strong>trailers</strong> activity maintained its growth path (+5.2%).<strong> Camping </strong>(+6.1%) and <strong>garden  equipment</strong> (+12.0%) activities have also recorded sustained improvements in the  third quarter.</p>
<p class="exergue">Financial situation</p>
<p>Trigano&rsquo;s  activity in the third quarter has had no significant impact on the  company&rsquo;s financial situation. </span></p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
<p>The  new ranges of motor caravans and caravans presented to the  distributors in June have been well received. Trigano is also  pursuing its reorganization programs aimed at making the company more  competitive and remains attentive to external growth opportunities in  leisure vehicles and trailers.</p>
