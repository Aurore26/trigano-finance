<p>Strong earnings growth reflected the surge in activity, but also cost  control and productivity increase despite the integration and the training of  additional production operators.<br>
  The achievement of a fiscal integration  between Trigano&rsquo;s business units in Italy, permitted by the new Italian tax  law, led to a deferred tax asset of €17.2 M.<br>
  Given the positive contribution of equity  affiliates (5.6 M€), net profit reached €89.7 M, or €4.68 per share.<br>
  Cash flow stood at €113.7 M, an increase of 48.8%  compared to 2014/2015. It was used to finance capital expenditures for an  amount of €28.6 M, to pay the dividend of €13,4 M and to strengthen the  financial structure despite the increase in working capital due to the surge in  activity.<br>
Trigano entered the 2016/17 fiscal year with a  consolidated net equity of €489.7 M and a net cash position of €58.2 M.</p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
<p>The European motorhome market, in a growth phase, leads the company to  expect a marked increase in its activity and results in 2016/2017.<br>
  The investment programme initiated in 2014/2015 should provide  sufficient production capacities to answer the increasing demand. Trigano will again  allocate significant amounts to capital expenditures in order to further  increase production capacities, to enhance productivity and working conditions in  all of its plants.<br>
  Regarding marketing, the brands portfolio of  leisure vehicles will gradually be exploited more rationally at the European level  by completing the currently insufficient distribution network of certain brands.  This action should  generate gains in market shares.<br>
With its robust financial structure and  therefore solid financial capacities, Trigano will seek to implement new  external growth operations targeted at the motorhomes and trailers sectors.</p>
<p class="exergue">Dividend</p>
<p>The Executive Board will propose to the General Meeting scheduled for 9  January 2017 the payment of a dividend in the amount of € 1.00 per share. </p>
