<p class="exergue">Leisure vehicles</p>
<p>Motor-caravan sales have resisted well. Despite a decrease  in the fourth quarter (-4.9%), due to the will of distribution networks to  reduce the level of their stocks, sales at constant perimeter were down 2.0% only in the financial year. <br />
  Caravan sales were down 22.0% in the quarter and  22.8% in the financial year.&nbsp; The  increase in living caravan deliveries has only slightly offset lower touring  caravan sales in France and in Southern Europe due to the implementation of  austerity programmes. <br />
  The deliveries of static caravans remained on a  good dynamics (+10.1% in Q4), confirming the good positioning of Trigano&rsquo;s  products. Sales are up 23.4% in the financial year. <br />
Finally, with the contribution of OCS, annual sales  of accessories for leisure vehicles have increased by 10.0% (+2.8% at constant perimeter). </p>

<p>Trailer sales,  which have benefited in the quarter of the contributions of Gaupen Henger and  Lider, have increased by 51.7% (+10.1% at constant perimeter). In the  financial year, sales are up 12.1%  (+2.4% at constant perimeter). <br />
Camping (-5.4% in Q4; -9.3% in the financial year) and  garden (+5.3% in Q4; -8.3% in the financial year) equipments, despite being  better oriented in the fourth quarter, have not recovered the decrease of the third  quarter, due notably to unfavourable weather conditions.</p>
<p class="exergue">Perspectives</p>
<p>In line with expectations, the results of the first  Autumn fairs and trade shows are slightly down compared to the level of last  year, reflecting the customers&rsquo; wait-and-see attitude. <br />
Backed by a sound financial structure, Trigano is  going to pursue its policy of strengthening market shares in 2012/2013, with  the continuation of its differentiation strategy based on innovation and  through external growth operations. In parallel, Trigano will maintain a prudent  and rigorous management strategy in order to adapt rapidly its production  capacities to the changes in demand on its main markets.</p>
