<p class="exergue">Leisure Vehicles</p>
<p>Investments  made in the last two years in order to increase its production capacity enabled  Trigano to continue conquering market shares in Europe despite some  difficulties affecting the supply of wheelbases and some components early in  the quarter: <strong>motorhome </strong>sales were up  17.8%.<br>
  Sales  of <strong>caravans</strong> (+16.9%) were also well-oriented, mainly due to  a strong growth of touring caravans. Sales of <strong>accessories for leisure vehicles </strong>remained stable (+0.2%).<br>
The evolution of <strong>static caravan </strong>sales (+130.7%), in low season, does not reflect a  tendency for the year. </p>
<p class="exergue">Leisure Equipment</p>
<p><strong>Trailers</strong> activity was up 8.5% thanks  to a marked recovery in sales in France and Nordic countries.<br>
The evolution of <strong>camping</strong> (+28.5%) and <strong>garden</strong> (-3.1%) <strong>equipment</strong> sales are not  significant in the first quarter, due to the seasonality of these activities.</p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
<p>The  development of production capacities will continue regularly in the next three  years. The delivery of strongly growing motorhomes order backlog during the  coming months and the focus on achieving the medium-term needs of distribution  networks are the primary objectives that Trigano had set. They are currently  proving particularly relevant.</p>
<p>At the same  time, other projects, aimed at modernising the existing production tool on an accelerated basis and at improving  working conditions, will be implemented in a continuous process.</p>
<p>These investments should allow Trigano to fully  benefit from the European leisure vehicles market recovery.</p>
<p>Its strong  financial structure will enable Trigano to continue the implementation of  necessary investments in physical and human capital, to finance an accelerated  growth, and although to seize any acquisition opportunity with strategic relevance.</p>
