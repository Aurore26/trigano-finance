</table>
<p>Current operating result reached &euro;37.6 M in the first half-year, representing 6.1% of sales (3.5% in 2014/2015). The results in the period benefited from the strong growth in activity, the improved productivity on most of the sites and from the control of operating expenses.</p>
<p>The financial result is positive (+&euro;1,5 M). The cost of financial debt (&euro;0.9 M), down by 20%, is more than offset by gains on currency hedging transactions (+&euro;2.4 M). Considering corporate tax expense of &euro;9.3 M and a positive contribution of equity affiliates (&euro;2.1 M, up by &euro;0.9 M), the net consolidated result stood at &euro;31.9 M compared with &euro;10.7 M in 2015.</p>
<p>Thanks to the effective management of the seasonal change in working capital requirements, net debt, traditionally at its high level at the end of the first half-year, reached &euro;30.1 M as at February 29 (&euro;56.6 M in 2015), representing only 6.9% of equity (15.1% in 2015). </p>
<p>During the first half-year, Trigano continued to implement its capital expenditure program aimed at satisfying the growing demand, strengthening the competitiveness of the company and improving its profitability. Capital expenditure totalled &euro;11.2 M, substantially higher than in the first half-year 2015 (&euro;6.2 M).</p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
	<p>The high level of motorhomes order backlog and the confirmation of the recovery of motorhomes markets in Europe point to a sustained activity in the second half-year. Trigano will continue to implement its capital expenditure programs to gain market share in the motorhomes, accessories for leisure vehicles and trailers sectors in Europe. Its strong financial structure (shareholder&rsquo;s equity over &euro;436 M) will enable Trigano to seize any external growth opportunity of strategic relevance.</p>
