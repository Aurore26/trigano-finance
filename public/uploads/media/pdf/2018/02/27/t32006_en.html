      <p>After a sustained growth in first-half sales, the leisure vehicles activity is well-oriented. The sales of motor caravans (+6.2%), accessories (+8.7%) and static caravans (+12.0%) are in significant progress. The sales of touring caravans are stable (+2.0%) whereas the difficulties encountered by the UK and Dutch markets are detrimental to the business of trailer tents (-38.2%).<br>
        Owing to the impact of climatic conditions in April and May, sales of camping (-6.3%) and garden (-17.5%) equipment did not come up to expectation.<br>
        The trailers activity keeps in line with the good level of sales recorded last year during the third quarter. <br>
      These results as a whole enable Trigano to confirm the year-end sales (&euro;880m) and EBIT margin (10.2% of the sales) targets for 2006.</p>
      
      <p>The introduction of a new generation of chassis for motor caravans resulted in reshaping in-depth the ranges for the 2007 season. The new models were given a particularly warm welcome by the distribution networks: the orders of show models are in strong progress compared to last year.<br>
        Supported by its leadership, the increase in its production capacities and the renewal of its product range, Trigano will benefit from the accelerated growth of the motor caravan market in Europe in order to stand its strong growth pace.</p>
