<p class="exergue">Leisure vehicles</p>
<p>The increase in production volumes resulting from the replenishment of order books led to post
  29.2% growth in motor-caravan sales in the second quarter. The systematic destocking done
  by distribution networks is now over in most European markets. Sales of caravans (+28.2%)
  and static caravans (+49.9%) are also well oriented, while those of accessories for leisure
  vehicles (+2.2%) linked mostly to the number of vehicles on the road have kept pace with the
evolution of consumers demand.</p>
<p class="exergue">Leisure equipment</p>
      <p>Trailer sales (+4.7%) came back to growth during the quarter, but the year-to-date remained
        down compared to the previous fi nancial year.<br />
        Garden (+11.3%) and camping equipment (+46.4%) activities are in low season and their
        performance, though very positive in the second quarter, is not significant.<br />
      </p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
      <p>The increase in Trigano business activity should continue in the second half-year thanks
        to the clients&rsquo; renewed confi dence, in an ongoing leisure vehicle market cleaning up. The
        restructuring and cost reduction measures implemented have reinforced Trigano&rsquo;s resilience
        and should allow for a return to strong profi tability from 2011. In the medium term, the
        sociologic, economic and ecologic assets of leisure vehicles should emerge stronger from the
        crisis.<br />
