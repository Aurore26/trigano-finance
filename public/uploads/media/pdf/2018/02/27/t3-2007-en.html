      <p>The growth of the activity during the third quarter falls markedly short of the expectations.</p>
      
      <p class="exergue">The Leisure Vehicles activity performs unevenly :</p>
      <p>Sales from Eura Mobil are down 13.8 M&euro; as against last year third quarter. Technical and logistical problems have not been completely solved. As at end of May, 600 motor caravans which had left the production line incomplete could therefore not be marketed. <br>
        The sales of motor caravans from the other Business Units (+6.8% on average) are increasing in accordance with the expectations.<br>
      Sales of touring caravans (+14.4%) and the accessories trading business (+6.7%) are well-oriented, despite a sluggish consumption.</p>
      
     <p class="exergue">The Leisure Equipment activity is in slight increase :</p>
     <p>The success of the new ranges of Polish trailers as well as the good performance of the B-to-B trailers are instrumental in a growth of trailers sales (+4.8%).<br>
    The sales of garden equipment (-6.9%) were inhibited by poor weather conditions and a lifeless consumption during the month of May. By contrast, sales of camping equipment increased by&nbsp;8.9%.</p>
     <p>The industrial difficulties encountered by Eura Mobil, on account of which the outlook for return to a balanced profitability for this Business Unit during the second half-year is called into question, coupled with the disruptions in production by Auto Trail entailed by the flood of June 26th in its Immingham factory (North Lincolnshire), will lead Trigano to revise its year-end turnover and operating profit targets downwards. </p>
