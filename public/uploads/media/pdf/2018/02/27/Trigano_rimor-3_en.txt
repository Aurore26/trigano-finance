<p class="exergue">Finalisation of the acquisition of Rimor</p>
<p>The Commercial Court of Siena has approved the arrangement with creditors of the company Autocaravans Rimor which puts an end to the process of takeover of the assets of this company by Luano Camp, subsidiary of Trigano.</p>
<p>This expected decision allows Trigano to become the owner of the brands RIMOR and KENTUCKY and therefore to strengthen its business on the low cost segment.</p>
<p>Rimor, located in Poggibonsi (Italy) close to the Italian factories of Trigano, has sold around 1.200 motorhomes in 2013/2014. Trigano anticipates full-year sales around &euro; 50M in the short term.</p>
