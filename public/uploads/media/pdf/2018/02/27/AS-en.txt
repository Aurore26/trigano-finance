<p class="exergue">Acquisition of Auto-Sleepers Investments Ltd</p>
<p>Trigano announces the acquisition of the company  Auto-Sleepers Investments Ltd (ASI), manufacturer and dealer of leisure vehicles in the United-Kingdom. Since the  acquisition of SEA, TRIGANO was a minority shareholder of the company.</p>
<p>The two  managers of ASI remain in office. </p>
<p>Established in 1961, the company has developed  the manufacturing of motorhomes sold under the brand Auto-Sleepers, which hence  is one of the oldest European brands. ASI is also active for several years in  the distribution of motorhomes and caravans, which, under the brand Marquis,  became the UK&rsquo;s leading recreational vehicle sales network. Auto-Sleepers employs  386 people and achieved a turnover of M&pound; 121 in 2016.</p>
<p>This acquisition will allow TRIGANO to  consolidate its presence in the UK motorhome market and shall generate many  synergies (purchasing, industrial and commercial). It is part of TRIGANO&rsquo;s  strategy of development through external growth in the fields of leisure  vehicles, accessories for leisure vehicles and trailers.</p>
