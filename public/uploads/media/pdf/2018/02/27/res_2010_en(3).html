<p>The current operating profit reached &#8364;24.6 M, which is  an improvement of &#8364;39.2 M compared to 2009. <br />
Annual results benefited from the improvement of gross  margin, from the effect of the savings programmes on overhead costs and from  the non recurrence of last year&acute;s costs related to the adaptation to the crisis  situation. </p>
<p>Thanks to the decrease in short-term debt, financial result improved by  &#8364;2.2 M. Considering a corporate tax income of &#8364;6.7 M and the contribution of  Loisirs Finance to consolidated results up to &#8364;3.3 M, net consolidated result  stood at &#8364;15.2 M (loss of &#8364;15.9 M in 2009). </p>
<p>Thanks mainly to a further decrease in stocks (&#8364;38.7 M) and in accounts  receivables (&#8364;11.9 M) and to the reconstitution of accounts payable linked to  the increase in production (&#8364; +24,0 M), working capital requirement decreased  by &#8364;70.5 M. In two years, this decrease amounts &#8364;158.5 M. As a result, Trigano&acute;s  financial structure is strengthened with a shareholder&acute;s equity lifted to &#8364;302.8  M and a net cash position of &#8364;12.0 M (net debt of &#8364;93.0 M as of 31 August  2009). </p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
<p>The increase in order books fuelled by the commercial success of  Trigano&acute;s products on Autumn shows and fairs suggests further sales growth. This  expected evolution of sales combined with the recovery of the business-units in  difficulty should lead to an improvement of the results in 2011. On the back of  its solid financial structure, Trigano should fully benefit from the  opportunities offered by the exit of the crisis, including external growth, in  order to continue to reinforce its market shares in Europe.</p>
<p> The Board of Directors will submit to the General meeting scheduled for  11 January 2011 the payment of a dividend of 0.10 &#8364; per share. </p>
