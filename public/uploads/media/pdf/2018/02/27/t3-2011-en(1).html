<p class="exergue">Leisure Vehicles</p>
<p>Sales of motor caravans continued to show  progress (+5.8% in Q3; +10.3% over 9 months) thanks to a good performance in France and in Germany and despite the decline of  the Italian and British markets. The growth in caravan sales (+2.8%) led to an  increase of +0.3% over 9 months, while that of static caravan deliveries (+57.9%  in Q3; +21.1% over 9 months) confirms Trigano&rsquo;s ramp-up<strong> </strong>on this market  segment. <br />
Thanks to a clear recovery in May, sales of  accessories for leisure vehicles are back in the third quarter to the level  recorded last year (+0.3%).</p>
<p class="exergue">Leisure Equipment</p>
<p>Leisure equipment activity accelerated its growth in the third quarter  on all segments: trailers (+13.4%), garden equipment (+18.1%) and camping equipment (+31.7%).</p>
<p class="exergue">Financial situation</p>
<p>The seasonal reduction in working capital requirements as well as the  profits generated at the end of May led to a return to a largely positive cash  position while allowing to intensify the policy of early payment of suppliers.</p>
<p class="exergue">Prospects</p>
<p>The success met by the new ranges of motor caravans and caravans with  distributors is expected to pave the way in 2011/2012 for the continuation of  sales and earnings growth. This also comforts Trigano&rsquo;s competitive positioning  and targets of market share gains in Europe.</p>
