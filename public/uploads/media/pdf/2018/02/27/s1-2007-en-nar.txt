      <p class="exergue">&ldquo;Narrative&rdquo; half-year financial report</p>
      <p>(issued according to AMF temporary recommandation)</p>
      
      <p><strong>Trigano carried out sales of 448.8 M&euro; during the first half-year 2006/2007, increasing by 7.1% compared to last year.</strong></p>
      
      <p class="exergue">Leisure vehicles</p>
      <p>The take-off of the plants of Sabl&eacute;-sur-Sarthe and Pe&ntilde;iscola as well as the recourse to additional human resources allowed to make up for the poor productivity of certain business units entailed by the introduction if the new base vehicles and to deliver enough of exhibition models of the new range to the distribution network. The sales of motor caravans have therefore increased by 6.6% compared to the first half-year 2005/06.</p>
      <p>Sales of caravans (+3.3%) and accessories for leisure vehicles (+14.8%, of which organic growth: +6.2%) are also well oriented.</p>
      
      <p class="exergue">Leisure Equipment</p>
      <p>The leisure Equipment segment takes advantage of the buoyancy of the trailers activity (+15.6%). Half-year-on-half-year changes in the sales of camping (-30.6%) and garden equipment (+7.7%) shall not be considered as material owing to the seasonal patterns followed by both activities.</p>
      
      <p class="exergue">Results</p>
      <p>Disruptions in production entailed by the introduction of the new wheel bases for motor caravans have, as expected, contributed negatively to the half-year results, in particular for the business units producing top-of-the-range vehicles (Eura Mobil, Autostar and Autotrail). Consequently, the half-year current operational profit should be around 21 M&euro; (28.6 M&euro; in 2005/06).</p>
      
      <p>The return to normal operating conditions in the second half-year in most business units, the high level of the motor caravans order book coupled with the forecasted performances of the trailers activity allow to maintain the targets in terms of sales (940 M&euro;; +7.7%) and of operating profit ratio (8.5% of sales) for the financial year ending  August 31st 2007.</p>
      <p>Half year consolidated financial results will be disclosed on May 23rd, 2007 after stock exchange closing.</p>
