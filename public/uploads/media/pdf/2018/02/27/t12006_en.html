      <p>The sales figure for the first quarter is ahead of forecasts.</p>
      <p>The leisure vehicles activity shows a strong organic growth. The sales of motor caravans (+&nbsp;18.1%) and caravans (+&nbsp;13.1%) grow fast whereas the accessories business is taking off again. Those changes are strengthened by the good improvement of the order book of motor caravans (+ 14.2% at the end of November within a constant perimeter). The taking off of the Peniscola plant and the starting up of that of Sabl&eacute;-sur-Sarthe should allow Trigano to satisfy this growing demand.</p>
<p>The sales of trailers are steady, which is a good performance when taking into account the high level of anticipated purchases in 2004 due to the fear of new raises of the steel prices. Because of seasonality, the sales figures of garden equipment and camping equipment are not very significant.</p>
		
        <p class="exergue">2006 PROSPECTS</p>
        <p>The continuing growth of the leisure vehicles markets in Europe should allow Trigano to reach a sales figure of &euro;M&nbsp;870 (excluding new acquisitions) and an operating margin level (EBIT / Sales) of about 10.2% in 2006. </p>
        <p>This information will be discussed at the end of the General Meeting, being held on Monday January 9, 2006 at 9:00&nbsp;am (French time) at the Salon Hoche, 9 avenue Hoche, 75008 Paris.</p>
